            <h4>Mission</h4>
            <p>Atlas’ mission is to provide safe, fun, affordable, clean, centrally located hostels around the world via foreign direct investment and/or franchise agreements. The company will embrace a pricing policy of transparency and value for money for its customers with no hidden charges, and work closely to meet the objectives of our shareholders. Increasing market share will be of central importance to the company’s long run growth strategy, whilst at the same time exercising financial prudence in light of the prevailing market conditions. Atlas’ aim to achieve a minimum occupancy of at least 65% each month for year 1 and 2, a customer satisfaction rate above 90%</p>
            <h4>Frontier Market Strategy</h4>
            <p>As developed world economies continue to face the prospect of anaemic growth for years to come, the emerging world, by contrast, will be a whirling hub of dynamism and creativity. Over the next decade it will account for more than 50% of global growth. It will see 700m people enter the middle class. And it will also account for a disproportionate share of business innovations.</p>
            <p>The frontier markets are a subset of these emerging markets. The frontier markets are typically pursued by company’s seeking high, long term revenue returns, global market penetration and low correlations with other economies and thus can provide additional revenue diversification to a company’s business operations.</p>
            <p>We believe that companies that succeed in emerging and frontier markets via foreign direct investment and/or franchise agreements are not only putting down roots in the world’s most fertile soil. They are giving themselves a chance to establish business habits for years to come.</p>
